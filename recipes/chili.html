    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>I always prep and cook the chili the night before and then reheat the next day.</p>
    <p>This is a combination of many different tomato-based chili recipes.</p>
    <p>Good luck and enjoy.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef chuck </li>
        <li>1 pound bulk Italian sausage </li>
        <li>3 (15 ounce) cans chili beans, drained </li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can chili beans in spicy sauce </li>
        <li>2 (28 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with juice </li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large stock pot over medium-high heat. Crumble the ground chuck and sausage into the hot pan, and cook until evenly browned. Drain off excess grease.</li>
        <li>Pour in the chili beans, spicy chili beans, diced tomatoes and tomato paste. Add the onion, celery, green and red bell peppers, chile peppers, bacon bits, bouillon, and beer. Season with chili powder, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, oregano, cumin, hot pepper sauce, basil, salt, pepper, cayenne, paprika, and sugar. Stir to blend, then cover and simmer over low heat for at least 2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>After 2 hours, taste, and adjust salt, pepper, and chili powder if necessary. The longer the chili simmers, the better it will taste. Remove from heat and serve, or refrigerate, and serve the next day.</li>
        <li>To serve, ladle into bowls, and top with corn chips and shredded Cheddar cheese.</li>
    </ol>
